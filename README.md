# WeatherFarm

Project Made for DotSlash 5.0 by 3 students of SVNIT Second Year:
Yash Shah (CSE)
Shashikant Dangi (CSE)
Nitin Rathod (ECE)

Problem Statement: Translate weather information to actionable advisory to farmers.

WeatherFarm is a website that aims to equip farmers with information that will allow them to manage their farms better. The user simply has to enter the name of their city and they will be provided with advisory based on the prevalent weather conditions. 

Tech stacks used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Express.js

Future scope: Currently the advisory is hard coded but we could potentially use machine learning so that the computer will look at the data and decide the appropriate advisory itself based on the weather conditions. We could also expand the website to include forecast for multiple days so there would be more accurate advisory given out. 

To view the project, open the server.js file and run it. Go to localhost:3000 and it will open the index page.
